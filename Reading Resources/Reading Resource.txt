Reading Resources  

Makinson: Sets, Logic and Maths for Computing
You are expected to have an understanding of basic discrete mathematics. If you need to brush up, the first two chapters of this electronic resource may be useful; they cover sets and relations.


Sedgewick: Algorithms in Java
A great resource, and not only for the Java programmers.  Chapter 2 covers analysis and Chapters 3-5 cover different data structures.


Skiena: The Algorithm Design Manual
Another great resource. This one uses C.  It is targeted at the practitioner, and the second half of the book is a "catalog of algorithmic problems".  That is useful, because often you want to ask "For this particular type of problem, what are the possible algorithms, and what are the trade-offs amongst them?"
